        "\n",
        "* a professor expects an exam average to be roughly 75%, and wants to know if the actual scores line up with this expectation. Was the test actually too easy or too hard?\n",
        "* a manager of a chain of stores wants to know if certain locations have different revenues on different days of the week. Are the revenue differences a result of natural fluctuations or a significant difference between the stores’ sales patterns?\n",
        "*  a PM for a website wants to compare the time spent on different versions of a homepage. Does one version make users stay on the page significantly longer?\n",
        "\n",
        "Others involve categorical data, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "* a pollster wants to know if men and women have significantly different yogurt flavor preferences. Does a result where men more often answer “chocolate” as their favorite reflect a significant difference in the population?\n",

        "Let’s imagine the fictional business BuyPie, which sends ingredients for pies to your household, so that you can make them from scratch. Suppose that a product manager wants the average age of visitors to BuyPie.com to be 30. In the past hour, the website had 100 visitors and the average age was 31. Are the visitors too old? Or is this just the result of chance and a small sample size?\n",

        "When we conduct a hypothesis test, we want to first create a null hypothesis, which is a prediction that there is no significant difference. The null hypothesis that this test examines can be phrased as such: “The set of samples belongs to a population with the target mean”.\n",
        "\n",
        "The result of the 1 Sample T Test is a p-value, which will tell us whether or not we can reject this null hypothesis. Generally, if we receive a p-value of less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and state that there is a significant difference.\n",

        "Data analysts in the real world often still perform hypothesis on sets that aren’t exactly normally distributed. What is more important is to recognize if there is some reason to believe that a normal distribution is especially unlikely. If your dataset is definitively not normal, the numerical hypothesis tests won’t work as intended.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, imagine we have three datasets, each representing a day of traffic data in three different cities. Each dataset is independent, as traffic in one city should not impact traffic in another city. However, it is unlikely that each dataset is normally distributed. In fact, each dataset probably has two distinct peaks, one at the morning rush hour and one during the evening rush hour. The histogram of a day of traffic data might look something like this:\n",

        "To check for similarity between the standard deviations, it is normally sufficient to divide the two standard deviations and see if the ratio is “close enough” to 1. “Close enough” may differ in different contexts but generally staying within 10% should suffice.\n",
        "\n",
        "##3. The samples must be independent\n",
        "When comparing two or more datasets, the values in one distribution should not affect the values in another distribution. In other words, knowing more about one distribution should not give you any information about any other distribution.\n",

If we have two or more categorical datasets that we want to compare, we should use a Chi Square test. It is useful in situations like:\n",
        "\n",
        "An A/B test where half of users were shown a green submit button and the other half were shown a purple submit button. Was one group more likely to click the submit button?\n",
        "Men and women were both given a survey asking “Which of the following three products is your favorite?” Did the men and women have significantly different preferences?\n",
        "In SciPy, you can use the function chi2_contingency to perform a Chi Square test.\n",
        "\n",
        "The input to chi2_contingency is a contingency table where:\n",
        "\n",
        "The columns are each a different condition, such as men vs. women or Interface A vs. Interface B\n",
        "The rows represent different outcomes, like “Survey Response A” vs. “Survey Response B” or “Clicked a Link” vs. “Didn’t Click”\n",
        "This table can have as many rows and columns as you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the null hypothesis is that there’s no significant difference between the datasets. We reject that hypothesis, and state that there is a significant difference between two of the datasets if we get a p-value less than 0.05.\n",
        "\n"
